- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

## Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HookChat.git
   cd HookChat
   ```

2. **Set up the server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the client**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application**

   In the server directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   In a new terminal, in the client directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`
   - The server will be running on `http://localhost:3001`

## Testing the Application

1. **Basic Setup Test**

   - Add at least one matching interest
   - Click "Start Chatting"
   - Users should be matched if they share at least one common interest
